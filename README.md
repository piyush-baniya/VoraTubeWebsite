## ✨ About

**VoraTube** is a modern Android music player built with Flutter, focused on delivering a smooth, beautiful, and feature-rich local music experience.

It is designed around three principles:

* 🎨 **Beautiful UI** — modern, polished interfaces and animations
* ⚡ **Smooth experience** — responsive playback and navigation
* 🔒 **Local-first** — your music files and library stay on your device, and no account is required for the core player

VoraTube does not require an account to use the core music-player experience.

### Privacy

VoraTube is local-first: your music files, library and playback history are stored and processed on your device. The app may use network access for optional metadata enrichment, and the production build includes Firebase Analytics and Google AdMob. The full text is available in the in-app privacy policy and in [`PRIVACY_POLICY.md`](PRIVACY_POLICY.md).
